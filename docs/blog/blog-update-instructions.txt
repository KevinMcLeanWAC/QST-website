✅ Instructions for Adding a New Weblog Post in VitePress

1. Go to:
   docs/blog

2. Create a new file such as:
   2025-05-09-title-of-post.md

3. Open the file:
   docs/blog/index.md

4. Add a link to the new post by inserting a line under the heading:

   ## Posts

5. Example line to add:

   - 📄 [Title of Your Blog Post](/blog/2025-05-09-title-of-post)

🟨 The text inside [ ... ] is the title people will see

🟦 The text inside ( ... ) is the URL path to the post
    ⚠️ Do NOT include ".md" in the link — VitePress handles that automatically

---

✅ Example:

If you created a file named:
  docs/blog/2025-05-06-replication.md

You would link it like this:
  - 📄 [Replicating a Back Bet with a Portfolio of Lays](/blog/2025-05-06-replication)
