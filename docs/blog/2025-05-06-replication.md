# Replicating a Back Bet with a Portfolio of Lays

In a zero-spread, zero over-round market, backing one runner is mathematically identical to laying all others.

Let \( p_i \) be the true win probability for runner \( i \). With decimal odds \( O_i = \frac{1}{p_i} \), the lay stakes on all other runners \( j \ne i \) are:

$$
\text{Stake}_j = \frac{p_j}{1 - p_i}
$$

This creates a synthetically identical financial exposure â€” a perfect hedge.
